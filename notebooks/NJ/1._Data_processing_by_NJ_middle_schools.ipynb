    "## Limitations\n",
    "1. Some elementary schools go up to grade 6. For these schools' share of level 5 results is usually higher than in schools with grades 6-8 or 7-8. Since they teach only the first of the middle grades, they were excluded to make a more grounded view of the middle schools quality.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Some school names in the original NJSLA data are inconsistently spelled or contain errors in the records across different years. As a result, these discrepancies created separate entries in the allResultsAVG2015_23DF dataframe. Consequently, this has led to certain schools having multiple overlapping points on the map, with pop-ups displaying data for different years.\n",
    "While this may affect the visual clarity and completeness of the map, the current representation still provides a comprehensive overview of the academic proficiency of middle schools in New Jersey. Further data cleaning to eliminate this issue required spending more time and effort, which was unnecessary for the purpose of the project."
